** About The Project

[[file:screenshot.png]]

*** Motivation

I found the default behavior of =display-buffer= often unpredictable, leading to new buffers appearing in unexpected windows.
Digging into Emacs' window management led me to realize the power of =display-buffer-alist=, but configuring it directly can be complicated and confusing especially for new users.

=auto-side-windows= simplifies this process.
It provides a straightforward way to define rules based on buffer names or major modes, ensuring that specific buffers consistently open in designated side windows (top, bottom, left, or right).
The goal is to achieve a predictable, organized workspace, similar to layouts often found in IDEs, keeping the main editing area clear while providing easy access to complementary information.

*** Layout Concept

The package helps achieve layouts where side windows display non-primary information, keeping the central area focused on editing. A conceptual layout might look like this:

#+begin_src
     _________________________________________________
    |         top: compilation, grep, occur           |
    |_________________________________________________|
    | left:      |                       | right:     |
    | - dired    |                       | - Help     |
    | - treemacs |                       | - Info     |
    | - outline  |    Main Window Area   | - Magit    |
    |            |       (Editing)       |            |
    |            |                       |            |
    |            |                       |            |
    |____________|_______________________|____________|
    |              bottom: REPLs, shells              |
    |_________________________________________________|
    |                   Echo Area                     |
    |_________________________________________________|
#+end_src

This allows buffers like help, compilation logs, shells, or project trees to be accessible without disrupting the primary editing flow.

*** Inspirations

Thank you all!

** Getting Started

*** Prerequisites

- Emacs 30.1 or later.

*** Example Configuration

Hereâ€™s an example configuration using =use-package=:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package auto-side-windows
    :load-path "/path/to/auto-side-windows/"
    :custom
    ;; Top side window configurations
    (auto-side-windows-top-buffer-names
     '("^\\*Backtrace\\*$" "^\\*Compile-Log\\*$" "^COMMIT_EDITMSG$"
       "^\\*Org Src.*\\*" "^\\*Agenda Commands\\*$" "^\\*Org Agenda\\*$"
       "^\\*Quick Help\\*$" "^\\*Multiple Choice Help\\*$" "^\\*TeX Help\\*$"
       "^\\*TeX errors\\*$" "^\\*Warnings\\*$" "^\\*diff-hl\\*$"
       "^\\*Process List\\*$"))
    (auto-side-windows-top-buffer-modes
     '(flymake-diagnostics-buffer-mode locate-mode occur-mode grep-mode
                                       xref--xref-buffer-mode))

    ;; Bottom side window configurations
    (auto-side-windows-bottom-buffer-names
     '("^\\*.*eshell.*\\*$" "^\\*.*shell.*\\*$" "^\\*.*term.*\\*$"
       "^\\*.*vterm.*\\*$"))
    (auto-side-windows-bottom-buffer-modes
     '(eshell-mode shell-mode term-mode vterm-mode comint-mode debugger-mode))

    ;; Right side window configurations
    (auto-side-windows-right-buffer-names
     '("^\\*eldoc.*\\*$" "^\\*info\\*$" "^\\*Metahelp\\*$"))
    (auto-side-windows-right-buffer-modes
     '(Info-mode TeX-output-mode pdf-view-mode eldoc-mode help-mode
                 helpful-mode shortdoc-mode))

    ;; Example: Custom parameters for top windows (e.g., fit height to buffer)
    ;; (auto-side-windows-top-alist '((window-height . fit-window-to-buffer)))
    ;; (auto-side-windows-top-window-parameters '((mode-line-format . ...))) ;; Adjust mode-line

    ;; Maximum number of side windows on the left, top, right and bottom
    (window-sides-slots '(1 1 1 1)) ; Example: Allow one window per side

    :bind ;; Example keybindings (adjust prefix as needed)
    (:map global-map ; Or your preferred keymap prefix
          ("C-c w t" . auto-side-windows-display-buffer-top)
          ("C-c w b" . auto-side-windows-display-buffer-bottom)
          ("C-c w l" . auto-side-windows-display-buffer-left)
          ("C-c w r" . auto-side-windows-display-buffer-right)
          ("C-c w T" . auto-side-windows-toggle-side-window)) ; Toggle current buffer in/out of side window
    :hook
    (after-init . auto-side-windows-mode)) ; Activate the mode
#+end_src

** Usage

Once =auto-side-windows-mode= is enabled and configured, buffers matching your defined rules (by name regexp or major mode) will automatically be displayed in the specified side window.

** Customization

You can customize the behavior through the following variables (accessible via `M-x customize-group RET auto-side-windows RET`):

| Option                                                      | Type          | Description                                                                            |
|-------------------------------------------------------------+---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =auto-side-windows-{top,bottom,left,right}-buffer-names=      | list (string) | Regexps matching buffer names for each side.                                           |
| =auto-side-windows-{top,bottom,left,right}-buffer-modes=      | list (symbol) | Major modes for buffers for each side.                                                 |
| =auto-side-windows-{top,bottom,left,right}-extra-conditions=  | list (sexp)   | Additional conditions (e.g., `(category . ...)` for =display-buffer=) for matching.      |
| =auto-side-windows-{top,bottom,left,right}-window-parameters= | alist         | Window parameters (see =window-parameters=) applied to windows on this side.             |
| =auto-side-windows-{top,bottom,left,right}-alist=             | alist         | Action alist properties (e.g., =window-height=) applied for this side.                   |
| =auto-side-windows-common-window-parameters=                  | alist         | Window parameters applied to *all* side windows created by this package.                 |
| =auto-side-windows-common-alist=                              | alist         | Action alist properties (e.g., `(dedicated . t)`) applied for *all* side windows.        |
| =auto-side-windows-reuse-mode-window=                         | alist         | Specify sides (e.g., `((right . t))`) where windows can be reused for same major mode. |
| =auto-side-windows-{before,after}-display-hook=               | hook          | Hooks run before/after displaying a buffer in a side window.                           |
| =auto-side-windows-{before,after}-toggle-hook=                | hook          | Hooks run before/after toggling a buffer as a side window.                             |

** Commands

The package provides the following commands:

- =auto-side-windows-mode=: Global minor mode. Enable this to activate the automatic side window management based on your rules.
- =auto-side-windows-toggle-side-window=: If the current buffer is in a side window created by this package, move it to a normal window. If it was just moved out, move it back to its side window configuration. Useful for temporarily maximizing a side window buffer.
- =auto-side-windows-display-buffer-{top,bottom,left,right}=: Manually force the current buffer to be displayed in a side window on the specified side, overriding normal rules.
- =auto-side-windows-display-buffer-on-side=: Manually force the current buffer to be displayed in a side window on the specified side, overriding normal rules. Compared to the command above the user is prompted side in the minibuffer.

** Integration with Other Packages

=auto-side-windows= plays well with other common window and buffer management packages.

*** Popper Integration

You can configure [[https://github.com/karthink/popper][Popper]] to manage the side windows created by =auto-side-windows=. Define Popper's reference buffers using the same lists you use for =auto-side-windows=:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package popper
    :after auto-side-windows ; Ensure auto-side-windows variables are defined
    :hook (auto-side-windows-mode . popper-mode) ; Activate popper alongside
    :custom
    ;; Tell Popper to consider buffers matching auto-side-windows rules as popups
    (popper-reference-buffers
     (append auto-side-windows-top-buffer-names auto-side-windows-top-buffer-modes
             auto-side-windows-left-buffer-names auto-side-windows-left-buffer-modes
             auto-side-windows-right-buffer-names auto-side-windows-right-buffer-modes
             auto-side-windows-bottom-buffer-names auto-side-windows-bottom-buffer-modes))
    ;; Optional: Don't let Popper decide where to display, auto-side-windows handles that
    (popper-display-control nil) ; Or 'user if you prefer popper commands for display
    :config
    (popper-mode +1) ; Enable popper-mode
    (popper-echo-mode +1) ; Optional: echo area notifications
    :bind ;; Example bindings
    (:map your-prefix-map ;; e.g. my/toggle-map
          ("p" . popper-toggle)      ; Toggle last popup
          ("P" . popper-toggle-type) ; Toggle popups of specific type
          ("C-p" . popper-cycle)))   ; Cycle through visible popups
#+end_src

With this setup, you can use Popper commands (like =popper-toggle= or =popper-cycle=) to quickly hide/show/cycle through the side windows managed by =auto-side-windows=.

*** Ace Window Integration

[[https://github.com/abo-abo/ace-window][Ace Window]] can serve as a fallback mechanism for selecting a window when =display-buffer= doesn't find a suitable existing window or rule (including those from =auto-side-windows=).

Modify =display-buffer-base-action= to include =ace-display-buffer=. This tells Emacs to use Ace Window to ask you where to put a buffer if other methods fail.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (use-package ace-window
        :custom
        (display-buffer-base-action '(display-buffer-reuse-window
                                      display-buffer-in-previous-window
                                      ace-display-buffer))) ; Ask user via ace-window
    #+end_src

Now, if a command tries to display a buffer and no =auto-side-windows= rule applies and standard reuse fails, =ace-display-buffer= will trigger, letting you pick the window.

** Recommended Configurations

To further enhance the Emacs experience with =auto-side-windows=, consider adding these configurations:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Org mode: Ensure agenda buffers open in the top side window for easy access
  (setq org-agenda-window-setup 'current-window)
  (add-to-list 'auto-side-windows-top-buffer-names "^\\*Org Agenda\\*$")

  ;; Magit: Display Magit status in the right side window
  (setq magit-display-buffer-function #'display-buffer)
  (add-to-list 'auto-side-windows-right-buffer-modes 'magit-mode)
  (add-to-list 'auto-side-windows-right-buffer-names "^magit:.*")
#+end_src

These configurations integrate well with =auto-side-windows= and enhance buffer management for specific use cases in Emacs.

** Comparison with Other Packages

While several packages address window management, =auto-side-windows= has a specific focus:

*** Shackle
[[https://github.com/alphapapa/shackle][Shackle]] is a powerful package for finely controlling how and where popup windows appear, including options for creating new frames or specifying precise window parameters. It's very flexible and can involve more complex rule definitions.

*Difference:* =auto-side-windows= focuses *specifically* on simplifying the common use case of assigning buffers to *side windows* within the *current frame* based on simple name/mode matching, acting as a high-level interface to =display-buffer-alist= for this purpose.

*** Popper
[[https://github.com/karthink/popper][Popper]] excels at *managing* buffers that are already considered "popups". It allows you to quickly toggle, cycle through, and manage the visibility of these popup windows.

*Difference:* =auto-side-windows= *defines which buffers should become* side windows in the first place. Popper can then be configured to *manage* these side windows created by =auto-side-windows= rules (see [[#popper-integration][Popper Integration]]). They work well together.

*** Core Emacs (=display-buffer-alist=)
Emacs' built-in =display-buffer-alist= is the underlying mechanism for controlling buffer display. It's extremely powerful but requires writing potentially complex alist structures.

*Difference:* =auto-side-windows= acts as a configuration layer *on top of* =display-buffer-alist=. It generates the necessary alist entries for side window rules based on user-friendly customization variables, reducing the need to write the raw alist entries manually for this common pattern.
